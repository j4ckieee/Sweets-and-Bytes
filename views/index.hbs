<p> Sweets &amp; Bytes is a local bakery shop that grosses an average of $450,000 in sales per year. The bakery has curated a collection of 50 different bakery goods - but their daily offerings are limited to just 18 items and the menu is constantly rotating. Since Sweets &amp; Bytes is growing at a rapid rate, they want to be able to track which items are doing the best so they can streamline their menu to minimize costs. They also want to be able to accurately keep track of total sales and manage customer orders. The website and database of Customers, Orders, Products, Order_Products will provide detailed information on the bakery’s products – as well as data about their monthly total numbers of orders and total grossed sales. This website will also allow employees to log/update their sales, enter/update customer information, and add/update bakery products.
